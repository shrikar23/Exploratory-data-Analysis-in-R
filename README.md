Exploratory data analysis of the Fine Particulate Matter in ambient air pollutants

The data set is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). It is released approximately every three years by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States. It measures the tonnes of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) emitted from each source for that particular year.

The goal of the project was to explore the data set and determine if there was any pattern to the air pollution levels over a ten year time period from 1999 to 2008. The following observations were made after analyzing the data set :

1. The total PM2.5 emissions have decreased from 1999 to 2008.

2. There was a slight spike in emissions in Baltimore City, Maryland from 2002 to 2005. But the overall pattern indicates a decrease in PM2.5 levels.

3. Although the overall trend has been a decrease in pollution levels, it was observed that the emissions from a certain type of source had actually increased over the 10 year period.

4. There was a slight spike in emissions from coal-combustion related sources from 2002 to 2005. However, the overall pattern indicates a decrease in PM2.5 levels
